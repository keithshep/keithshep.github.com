# Probability and Statistics

__Warning__: These notes are a work in progress and probably contain some errors. Please let me know at [keithshep@gmail.com](mailto:keithshep@gmail.com) know if you spot any.

## Resources

Books:

* *Bayesian Core: A practical approach to computational bayesian statistics* by martin and Robert
* *Computer Vision: models learning and inference* free PDF, answers and slides at http://www.computervisionmodels.com/

## Terminology & Notation

* __proportional to__: the "proportional to" relationship ($\propto$) is often used in bayesian stats when we don't care if both sides of the equation are equal but we do care that both sides of the equation are proportional

* __independence__: when $x$ and $y$ are independent, the probability of $y$ will not depend on $x$ and vice versa
  $$\begin{eqnarray}
  Pr(x|y) = Pr(x) \\
  Pr(y|x) = Pr(y)
  \end{eqnarray}$$
